Respected Sunbasedata company , my self Ashutosh Shewalkar , i have attempeted the given problems..

In this Project i have tried to work on both problems 
1. API fetch using REST from given url 
2. Circles and line renderer assignment 

----****  Key points and challanges faced by me in completing this Project. ****----

A) Circles Assignment was Correctly completed and ready to use .

B) Withing my knowledge i tried to complete circles one correctly . but API REST using URL  cannot be completed in time . My logic for implementing this particular problem is not sufficient for now . 
So in the 1st Assignment, we are fetching data properly with population of dropdown list /filtering of data using their positions . 
But popup menu is not functional/ Data is not populated . 
I hope you will consider this . 

C) The UI can be improved as i just overlooked on the UI part a bit , because i wanted to make the functionallity right . 

Thankyou .

Add circleLayerMask in Layers section , and also Add Circle in Tag section before starting as it may give circle collider error
